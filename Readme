1 Introduction   (  VCF2Dis version   <1.20)
 
	To new the p_distance matrix besed the VCF file. the more infomation
  about the  p_distance matrix ,see this website:
  http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/distance.html

  The VCF SNPs datasets were used to calculate p-distance between individuals, according to the follow formula to operate the sample i and sample j genetic distance:

                D_ij=(1/L) * [(sum(d(l)_ij))]

   Where L is the length of regions where SNPs can be identified, and given the alleles at position l are A/C:
        d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and AA;
        d(l)_ij=0.5     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and AC;
        d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AC and AC;
        d(l)_ij=1.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and CC;
        d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were CC and CC;

  After p_distance done , software PHYLIP 3.69 (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) ,with neighbor-joining method can was used to construct the phylogenetic tree on the basis of this  p_distance matrix;
       PHYLIPNEW-3.69.650/bin/fneighbor  -datafile p_dis.matrix  -outfile tree.out1.txt -matrixtype s -treetype n -outtreefile tree.out2.tre
 The MEGA6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/) was used to present the phylogenetic tree based this file [tree.out2.tre].


2 Install
  
  Just  [make]  or [sh  make.sh ]  to compile this software.
  the final software can be found in the Dir [bin/VCF2Dis]

 3.2 To new all the sample p_distance matrix based VCF, run VCF2Dis directly
	
       ./bin/VCF2Dis	-InPut	in.vcf.gz	-OutPut p_dis.mat

 3.3 To new sub group sample p_distance matrix ; Pput their sample name into File sample.list

      ./bin/VCF2Dis	-InPut	in.vcf.gz	-OutPut p_dis.mat  -SubPop  sample.list
