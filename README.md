		-help                Show more help [hewm2008 v1.50]

```

* 2) To Create the  p_distance matrix

```
# 2.1) To new all the sample p_distance matrix based VCF, run VCF2Dis directly
      ./bin/VCF2Dis	-InPut	in.vcf.gz	-OutPut p_dis.mat
      #  ./bin/VCF2Dis     -InPut  in.fa.gz	-OutPut p_dis.mat -InFormat  FA

# 2.2) To new sub group sample p_distance matrix ; put their sample name into File sample.list
      ./bin/VCF2Dis	-InPut	chr1.vcf.gz chr2.vcf.gz	-OutPut p_dis.mat  -SubPop  sample.list
```

* 3) construct nj-tree and present it (need deal with Other software)

#### method 1
   Choose one of **A/B**
   </br> **A.** Upload the web [fneighbor(http://emboss.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/emboss/fneighbor?_pref_hide_optional=1)](http://emboss.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/emboss/fneighbor?_pref_hide_optional=1) ï¼Œthe Click the **Run fneighbor** bottom . then you can get the output file **datafile.treefile**
   </br> **B.**  Upload the <b>p_dis.mat</b> to the website [fastme (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/)](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/), select <b>Data Type</b> to the  <b>Distance matrix </b>,Click the bottom twist <b>execute & email results</b>. you will get the <b>p_dis_mat_fastme-tree.nwk</b> , and Email not mandatory;
   

   Run  MEGA        #    The MEGA (http://www.megasoftware.net/) was used to present the phylogenetic tree based this file [p_dis_mat_fastme-tree.nwk]
 
#### method 2
   Use the PHYLIPNEW to construct nj-tree
</br>How to Install PHYLIPNEW please Click on <b> [here](https://github.com/hewm2008/VCF2Dis/blob/main/Install.NJ.en.md)</b> or Click on <b>[here(Chinese)](https://github.com/hewm2008/VCF2Dis/blob/main/Install.NJ.cn.md)</b>
```
      #    3.1 Run  PHYLIP
      #   After p_distance done , software PHYLIPNEW 3.69 (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) ,with neighbor-joining method can was used to construct the phylogenetic tree on the basis of this  p_distance matrix;
       
           PHYLIPNEW-3.69.650/bin/fneighbor  -datafile p_dis.matrix  -outfile tree.out1.txt -matrixtype s -treetype n -outtreefile tree.out2.tre

      #    3.2 Run  MEGA
      #    The MEGA6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/) was used to present the phylogenetic tree based this file [tree.out2.tre]
```
* 4) you can see the neighbor-joining tree and save it as PDF format


###  3) an Example of nj-tree with boostrap

* 1) muti-run the nj-tree by using  put back sampling.
To using the the part of the sites and new the nj-tree as above. Repeat For the <b>NN</b> times. X=(1,2....NN); 

```
    ./bin/VCF2Dis	-InPut	in.vcf.gz	-OutPut p_dis_X.mat    -Rand     0.25
    PHYLIPNEW-3.69.650/bin/fneighbor  -datafile p_dis_X.matrix  -outfile tree.out1_X.txt -matrixtype s -treetype n -outtreefile tree.out2_X.tre 
```

* 2) merge the all the  put back sampling  NJ-tree and construct  boostrap nj-tree.

```
	cat   tree.out2_*.tre   >  ALLtree_merge.tre
	PHYLIPNEW-3.69.650/bin/fconsense   -intreefile   ALLtree_merge.tre  -outfile out  -treeprint Y
	perl  ./bin/percentageboostrapTree.pl    ALLtree_merge.treefile    NN    Final_boostrap.tre
```
* 3) construct nj-tree and present it (need deal with Other software)
```
      #    The MEGA6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/) was used to present the phylogenetic tree based this file Final_boostrap.tre] 
```

###  4) Introduction
------------
To new the p_distance matrix besed the VCF file. the more infomation about the p_distance matrix, see <b>[this website.](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/distance.html)</b>
The VCF SNPs datasets were used to calculate p-distance between individuals, according to the follow formula to operate the sample i and sample j genetic distance:

                D_ij=(1/L) * [(sum(d(l)_ij))]

  </br> Where L is the length of regions where SNPs can be identified, and given the alleles at position l are A/C:
```
            d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and AA;
            d(l)_ij=0.5     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and AC;
            d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AC and AC;
            d(l)_ij=1.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were AA and CC;
            d(l)_ij=0.0     if the genotypes of the two individuals were CC and CC;
```
